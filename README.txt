The compiled executable is in BotGUI\BotGUI\bin\Debug\net8.0-windows\BotGUI.exe
The executable is dependent on the local directory \stockdata for which stock files to load. The current test data only includes 10 tickers to speed up the loading time. If you like, you can add the full data.

The full project solution built in Visual Studio 2022 is included. The code uses the .NET 8.0 framework for forms and was built in C#13.
